# UnityCNTK
#### Deep learning framework for Unity, backed by CNTK
##### Unslash your creativity, built for production
#### Windows only for now

### Planned Features
 
2. Texture synthesis
    - Create texture for tiling  
3. In-game AI evaluation
   - The evaluation API is containable should be able to ship with your game
4. Unlimited expensionality
   - Backend with CNTK that unlock the best performance
5. Examples 
    - Various applications to show the potential of CNTK
6. Actively maintained library
    - Include downloader to common state of the art available deep neural network
7. Built for performance
    - Calculation are all in background thread
    - Fully paralleled calculation
    - GPU Support


### Includes
1. Easy conversion from Unity classes to CNTK acceptable value
2. Plenty of examples to get your hand dirty
3. Pretrained Models ready to be deployed
4. Import existing CNTK models
5. Well-documented, properly commented code

### Technical Background
