# UnityCNTK
#### Deep learning framework for Unity, backed by CNTK
##### Unslash your creativity, built for production

### Planned Features
2. In-game AI evaluation
    - Containable API
3. Unlimited expensionality
    - Backend with CNTK that unlock the best performance
4. Examples 
    - Various applications to show the potential of CNTK
5. Rich library
    - Support CNTK Model V2
    - Include downloader to common state of the art available deep neural network
6. Built for performance
    - Calculation are all in background thread
    - Paralleled calculation
    - GPU Support
7. Crossplatform 
    - the entire framework is based on .Net 4.6
    - in English, that means it should run on most mainstream platforms that Unity supports (tested only on Windows and Ubuntu)
8. Full Source code
    - Entire implementation is C#
    - Poke around and let us know if you find any bug or improvement


### Requirement
1. Unity 2017 or later
    - Unity 5.x or before will NOT work for their lack of .NET 4.6 support


### Includes
1. Easy conversion from Unity classes to CNTK supported value
2. Plenty of examples to get your hand dirty
3. Pretrained Models ready to be deployed
4. Import existing CNTK models
5. Well-documented, properly commented code
6. Data exporter
7. Python data importer

### Example scenes
1. Image recognition
    - Recognize in-game object
2. Facial expression recognition (FER)
    - Recognize fa
    - Requires a front facing camera (Notebook computer will do)
    - 
    - Trained with [Microsoft FER+](https://github.com/Microsoft/FERPlus)
