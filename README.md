# UnityCNTK
#### Deep learning framework for Unity, backed by CNTK
##### Unslash your creativity, built for production
#### Windows only for now

### Planned Features
 
2. Texture synthesis
    - Create texture for tiling
3. In-game AI evaluation
    - Containable API
4. Unlimited expensionality
    - Backend with CNTK that unlock the best performance
5. Examples 
    - Various applications to show the potential of CNTK
6. Rich library
    - Support CNTK Model V2
    - Include downloader to common state of the art available deep neural network
7. Built for performance
    - Calculation are all in background thread
    - Paralleled calculation
    - GPU Support


### Includes
1. Easy conversion from Unity classes to CNTK supported value
2. Plenty of examples to get your hand dirty
3. Pretrained Models ready to be deployed
4. Import existing CNTK models
5. Well-documented, properly commented code
6. Data exporter

### Example scenes
1. Image recognition
    - Recognize in-game object
2. Facial expression recognition (FER)
    - Recognize fa
    - Requires a front facing camera (Notebook computer will do)
    - 
    - Trained with [Microsoft FER+](https://github.com/Microsoft/FERPlus)
